## DESCRIPTION:
"Do you struggle remembering that restaurant you went to with your friend last week? When someone asks you where you want to eat, is your response often something like "umm, well, I'm not sure, what are some good places? I have no memory of eating at a restaurant in my entire life!" Well, I have a simple solution for you. With the TASTIES app, users will be able to collect information about their favorite restaurants and store that information in one convenient list. Enjoyed that new sushi place that just opened around the corner? Log it in the app! Add details including the restaurant name, the dishes you ordered, best drinks from the bar, the price range, and a link to the restaurant's website. Also a place to add any notes such as 'celebrated dad's birthday here'."
